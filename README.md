# Citizen Action of New York Outreach Planning Calculator

This is a web-based tool that helps organize and plan outreach strategies for contacting people or turning out people to an event. The tool calculates the number of people you need to contact, broken down by different contact methods (phone banking, canvassing, tabling, etc.) while accounting for various success rates. It also includes a flake factor for event turnout, where a portion of RSVPs are expected to not show up.

## Features

1. **Contact People:**
   - Users can input how many people they want to contact.
   - The tool calculates a breakdown of how many people to contact per method (Phonebanking, Canvassing, Tabling, etc.), adjusting for each methodâ€™s success rate.
   - Option to filter by contact method (e.g., only Phonebanking, only Canvassing).

2. **Event Turnout:**
   - Users can input how many people they want to turnout for an event and the event date.
   - The tool calculates how many people need to be contacted, factoring in both success rates and the "flake factor" (only 50% of people who RSVP will likely show up).
   - Provides a suggested breakdown for the number of contacts per method needed to meet your turnout goal.

3. **Contact Method Success Rates:**
   - The tool accounts for the success rates of different outreach methods:
     - **Phonebanking:** 8% success rate
     - **Canvassing:** 15% success rate
     - **Tabling:** 25% success rate
     - **Street Canvassing:** 10% success rate

4. **Flexible User Interface:**
