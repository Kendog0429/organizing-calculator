# Citizen Action of New York Organizing Calculator

This tool helps organizers estimate how many people they need to contact and how to reach them through various contact methods (phonebanking, canvassing, tabling, or street canvassing). It factors in a 50% no-show (flake) rate for all outreach efforts, helping you create an effective outreach plan to meet your goals.

## Features

- **Estimates turnout**: Given a number of people to contact, it calculates the number of people you need to ask to ensure enough show up (considering a 50% no-show rate).
- **Multiple outreach methods**: Choose from different methods such as phonebanking, canvassing, tabling, and street canvassing. Each method has its own contact rate.
- **Creates a detailed outreach plan**: Based on your inputs, the tool suggests how many phonebanks, canvassing shifts, tabling sessions, or street canvassing shifts youâ€™ll need to meet your goal.
- **Flexible for different goals**: Allows users to either:
  - Plan outreach to contact a specific number of people, or
  - Plan turnout for a specific number of people at an event.
- **Filter by contact method**: Users can choose to filter by contact method (phonebanking, canvassing, etc.), making it easier to plan for specific seasons or preferences (e.g., phonebanking during winter).
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple steps with clear guidance on how to enter your data, providing a seamless planning experience.

## New Features

1. **Goal Selection**:
   - Users can select whether they are looking to **contact** or **turnout** a certain number of people.
   - Based on the selection, the tool either generates an outreach plan or turnout plan accordingly.

2. **Outreach Plan Creation**:
   - If users want to contact a certain number of people, the tool creates a general outreach plan that distributes outreach tasks (phonebanking, canvassing, etc.) as a template.
   - If users are turning out people to an event, they can also specify the event date and the target turnout goal.

3. **Filter by Contact Method**:
   - Users can optionally filter outreach by the method they prefer (e.g., phonebanking, canvassing).
   - This allows for more targeted outreach strategies based on time of year or campaign strategy.

4. **Improved User Interface**:
   - A more visually pleasing design with enhanced typography and interactive elements (e.g., buttons and input fields).
   - Smooth transitions between steps and clear sections to guide users through the process.
   - A clean, modern layout to make the tool more user-friendly and engaging.

## How It Works

1. **Step 1**: Choose your goal:
   - **Contact a certain number of people**: Plan outreach based on the number of people you wish to contact.
   - **Turnout a certain number of people for an event**: Plan turnout efforts for your event by specifying the number of people you want to attend and the event date.
   
2. **Step 2**: Optionally filter by contact method:
   - Select specific contact methods you wish to use (phonebanking, canvassing, tabling, or street canvassing).
   - This is helpful for seasonal strategies or specific outreach preferences.

3. **Step 3**: Generate your plan:
   - Based on your inputs, the tool will calculate the required outreach actions (phonebanks, canvassing shifts, etc.).
   - If turning out for an event, a tailored event turnout plan is generated based on your desired outcome.
