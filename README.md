# Citizen Action of New York Organizing Calculator

This tool helps organizers estimate how many people they need to contact and how to reach them through various contact methods (phonebanking, canvassing, tabling, or street canvassing). It factors in a 50% no-show (flake) rate for all outreach efforts, helping you create an effective outreach plan to meet your goals.

## Features

- **Estimates turnout**: Given a number of people to contact, it calculates the number of people you need to ask to ensure enough show up (considering a 50% no-show rate).
- **Multiple outreach methods**: Choose from different methods such as phonebanking, canvassing, tabling, and street canvassing. Each method has its own contact rate.
- **Creates a detailed outreach plan**: Based on your inputs, the tool suggests how many phonebanks, canvassing shifts, tabling sessions, or street canvassing shifts youâ€™ll need to meet your goal.
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple steps with clear guidance on how to enter your data.
