# Organizing Calculator

## Overview
The **Organizing Calculator** is a tool designed to help organizers plan and calculate how many people they need to contact to achieve their outreach goals. Based on inputs like the number of people needed, contact method, and contact rate, the tool provides a customized outreach plan and helps estimate how many phonebanks, canvassing shifts, or other outreach actions are required to meet your objectives.

## Features
- **Calculate Outreach**: Input the number of people you want to contact, the contact method (phonebanking, canvassing, etc.), and the contact rate.
- **Flake Factor**: Automatically accounts for no-shows based on a customizable "flake factor" (typically around 50%).
- **Actionable Plan**: Provides a breakdown of how many outreach actions (e.g., phonebanks, canvassing shifts) are needed to achieve the desired contacts.
- **Responsive**: Simple, clear user interface with step-by-step instructions.

## How It Works
1. **Enter your contact goal**: Input the number of people you want to contact.
2. **Select the contact method**: Choose between phonebanking, canvassing, or other methods.
3. **Provide a contact rate**: This is the percentage of people you will successfully reach out to (e.g., 8% for phonebanking).
4. **Input flake factor**: Estimate the percentage of people who might not show up even if they say yes (e.g., 50%).
5. **Get your outreach plan**: Click "Calculate Plan" to see how many phonebanks, canvassing shifts, or other actions are required.
